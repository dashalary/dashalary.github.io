The weekend before first project week I felt a little restless. I knew that we were to begin our CLI projects on Monday but I did not know what to expect. I assumed the process would be very difficult since it is our first project and I have never created anything like that before. I decided to alleviate some of my anxiety by making sure I have everything set up before I start working, such as my local environment, my github repository, etc. I am really glad I did that because on Sunday night I ran into a scary problem: I was unable to push my newly created project structure to Github! Thankfully, after doing some research I figured it out, and was no longer intimidated by VSCode. Despite not yet having any code, it was reassuring to see my project's skeleton with empty folders and files, as I felt like I had already 'started'. 

My next task was to find a good API. I love cats, so I knew I wanted to do my projects about cats, and I quickly found a cat related API. At first I thought I would have to include an API key, which was hard to wrap my head around (how and where do I include it?), but during one of the office hours sessions it was revealed to me that the API key was not necessary after all! That made my job much easier and I could proceed with writing my code.

The hardest part for me was figuring out the API file. In hindsight, it was actually a lot easier than it seemed, perhaps because my project did not require modifying the API link to get to a deeper level of information. I made a list of cat breeds and allowed the user to see that list, then choose a number from that list corresponding to a specific cat breed in order to see more information about the breed, and then exit. After all of that was done, I moved on to a very fun part where I stylized my project by including the Colorize gem to make things colorful, as well as some cute cat pixel art. 

I found that utilizing all of the office hours was crucial to my success, not only because I got to ask many questions, but also because simply working in the background and listening to others' questions helped me learn and get ideas and even feel more confident about the process. Additionally, I spent a lot of time working in a Zoom room with some people from the cohort, where we helped each other out and boosted our morale. Despite the fact that this was an independent project and we each did our own thing, the process felt collaborative and very supportive. I feel a little less scared by the code now.
