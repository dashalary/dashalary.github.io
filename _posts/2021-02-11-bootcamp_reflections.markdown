When I entered Flatiron's Software Engineering bootcamp at the age of 23, I, like many others who suddenly decide to pursue a radically different career path, was quite nervous. For whatever reason, I was convinced that everybody except me would be amazing at programming from day one, that I'd fall behind and not be able to keep up with the workload, that it would be too difficult... Thanks, anxiety. Eventually every single one of those thoughts proved themselves to be false. When I look back at the last five months, there are a couple of things (in no particular order) that I consider crucial to my success at Flatiron, which I'd encourage anybody who's starting programming bootcamp to take note of. 

1. Be active in your cohort channel! Seriously, keep that tab open all day while you're working. I could not have gotten this far in my coding journey without the help of the friends I've made in my cohort. How did I make these friends? Well, here's how: during the first project week when everyone was still all over the place and confused about the purpose of an IDE, one person opened up a Zoom room in case anybody wanted to work on their projects together and help each other out. Despite never having spoken to this person before, I entered the Zoom room and got to know him. Then two more people joined us. That day the four of us made our own little group chat that is still going strong to this day. While the size of the cohort shrunk after each module, the people who were most active in lectures and the cohort channel were the ones that made it to the end. I am confident that it is because they were a) not afraid to ask for help every time they needed it, and b) made personal connections with their fellow cohort members, which has exponential benefits, particularly when times get tough, as life doesn't pause itself just because you're in a bootcamp. 

2. Work ahead if you can. It may be tempting to finish the day early, but you never know what lab is coming next and how long it'll take you to complete it. This is especially true right before the project week. You will likely face annoying git issues while trying to start the project, some of which (if you're unlucky like me) may take hours to fix. This happened to me every single weekend before project week without exception. So think ahead, plan ahead, and work ahead. This way you can help others as well, and helping others (even if you end up not being able to solve their problem!) means ~everything~. People appreciate and remember those who took their time to help them. It gives others permission to help others, whereas before they may have lacked confidence to do so. Start the ~teamwork~ energy in your group as early as you can! 

3. Share resources (blog posts, StackOverflow links, videos), no matter how big, small, or random they are. Post them in your cohort channel. Acknowledge other people's posts (preferably with a heart or cat emoji), this strengthens your community (which continues after you graduate...).


I am immensely grateful for my experience at Flatiron, which was entirely positive due to how supportive the environment was. I hope that my little piece of advice inspires others to contribute to the success and welfare of their work environment, too.
